# CSIT203 Assignment One

This repository contains the implementation of various data structures, including AVL Trees, Max Heap, and Min Heap, as part of the CSIT203 course assignment. The project demonstrates the use of these data structures for word processing and efficient data handling.

## Features
- **AVL Tree Implementation:** Self-balancing binary search tree for efficient data operations.
- **Max Heap and Min Heap Implementations:** Data structures for priority queue operations.
- **Word Processing:** Uses data structures for efficient word processing tasks.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CSIT203-Assignment-One.git
   ```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio:
   ```bash
   Open "CSIT203 Assignment 1.sln" in Visual Studio.
   ```
3. Build and run the project using Visual Studio.

## Usage
- Sample input files (`sample-long.txt` and `sample-short.txt`) are provided for testing the data structures.
- Run the compiled program and follow the prompts to process these input files.
